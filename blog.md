## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

The first week is about what I had expected. It was a good introduction to the self-learning elements of the course, and helped me understand how to prioritize material. At first pass, you're not always going to understand the concept -- practice is where the knowledge gets solidified.
 
## What are you struggling with?

I often feel like I don't understand why we're doing something the way we are until I've practiced several times, then it suddenly makes sense. It's hard to wade through that initial confusion but rewarding once it clicks.
 
## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

Everything! Particularly practicing JavaScript.
