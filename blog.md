## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

The first week is about what I had expected. It was a good introduction to the self-learning elements of the course, and helped me understand how to prioritize material. At first pass, you're not always going to understand the concept -- practice is where the knowledge gets solidified.
 
## What are you struggling with?

I often feel like I don't understand why we're doing something the way we are until I've practiced several times, then it suddenly makes sense. It's hard to wade through that initial confusion but rewarding once it clicks.
 
## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

Everything! Particularly practicing JavaScript.

## What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?
 
Last week pseudo coding was pretty difficult becasue I was still getting my feet under me. I think it'll be easier and more helpful this coming week, now that I have a sense of how our basic tools (terminal, VS Code, etc) work and can use them compitently. 

## What are you struggling with?
Just trying to make sure I get enough actual project practice in during the week. I'm going to keep focusing on getting through the readings and to the projects as quickly as possible (while still retaining the info), because the projects are where the info is solidified. 
 
## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I am *really* excited to get started on JavaScript this coming week.
