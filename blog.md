## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

The first week is about what I had expected. It was a good introduction to the self-learning elements of the course, and helped me understand how to prioritize material. At first pass, you're not always going to understand the concept -- practice is where the knowledge gets solidified.
 
## What are you struggling with?

I often feel like I don't understand why we're doing something the way we are until I've practiced several times, then it suddenly makes sense. It's hard to wade through that initial confusion but rewarding once it clicks.
 
## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

Everything! Particularly practicing JavaScript.

## What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?
 
Last week pseudo coding was pretty difficult becasue I was still getting my feet under me. I think it'll be easier and more helpful this coming week, now that I have a sense of how our basic tools (terminal, VS Code, etc) work and can use them competently. 

## What are you struggling with?
Just trying to make sure I get enough actual project practice in during the week. I'm going to keep focusing on getting through the readings and to the projects as quickly as possible (while still retaining the info), because the projects are where the info is solidified. 
 
## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I am *really* excited to get started on JavaScript this coming week.

## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

You can make a nice looking site with html and CSS, but if you want it to be functional then JavaScript is the key. A modern, interactive UI needs JavaScript (or another language) to make the interface work rather than just be aesthetically pleasing. 
 
## What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

My blog incorporates posts, drop-down headings, and a main header. 
 
## What are your thoughts on pseudo coding now?
 
When you're pseudo-coding, it's more important to think abstractly rather than to think too much about how it will look when it's written out in the coding language. You need to think of all contingencies and set up your expectations and givens properly, so that you can have a solid base going forward.
