Pseudocode for Wk 1 Prework Blog

Steps

1. Go to my BootCamp directory in terminal
2. Create folder in BootCamp directory called my_user_name.github.io
3. Create GitHub repository in terminal using my my_user_name.github.io
4. Connect the repository with GitHub 
5. Create readme file - commit that file to main 
6. Also in my my_user_name.github.io, create blog file, img folder, and pseudocode file
7. In terminal, create dev branch seperate from main in the my_user_name.github.io directory.
7. Create the contests of the blog file in VS Code. Paste the pseudocode into the pseudocode file in VS Code
8. Save VS Code files and commit to repository in dev branch
9. Push to dev branch in GitHub
10. Merge branches
11. Share site


Will need to have: 
-File for posts
-A README.md file (understand what is stored inside this repository and how the user can run the code)
-An image folder
-.gitignore file
-A pseudocode.md file

This go-around, my pseudocode was less planning and more figuring out what works while writing it down.
