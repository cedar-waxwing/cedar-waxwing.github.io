 What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why? <br>
 The top thing that held me back this week was feeling like I didn't have a good handle on the syntax yet. I'm getting better, but it's overwhelming at first. <br>
What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures)? <br>
 Definitely data structures! I feel like I have a good intro but want to get much more comfortable in this area. <br>
What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding Bootstrap or Atomic Design?<br>
